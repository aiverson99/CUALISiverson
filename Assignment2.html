<h2>Accessing using Nielsen’s Heuristics</h2>
<p>To access the usability of the Tower's digital archives we can look at it through the lens of Nielsen’s heuristics. The first of these heuristics is the visibility of system status. The website does have a loading status bar when the user opens the newspaper files. I noticed though that it takes a long time for the file to load and the progress bar remains even after everything has loaded. The bar only disappeared when I went to search for a keyword in the issue. Another facet of Nielsen’s heuristics is user control and freedom. The Tower allows users to go back easily using the back button on the browser. It also allows the user to X out keywords in their search with a click of a button. The website struggles with consistency and standards, when searching under the “date” sort the website struggles. The date sort is not accurate with the first dates appearing being the 2000s and later it goes to the 1980s then the 1930s. This is weird because the sort filter is supposed to be oldest to newest. The site also lacks error prevention. When a word is misspelled it does not tell the user, it just comes back with a page that reads “Sorry, but your search returned no results”.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with the Tower’s website is its search bar. The Tower’s archive isn't its own website but part of Catholic’s digital archives. When brought to the Towers page the search bar has a drop-down menu of where to search for things. Automatically it has “search this collection” selected which means the user is only getting results from the Towers collection. Something I noticed though was if there were few or no results this dropdown menu changed to “all collections” meaning that any search after will pull up results from all of the CUA digital archives. Once the search bar has moved to look at “all collections” the option to move the results back to “this collection” disappears in the drop-down menu. This means that the user must either go back on their browser or reload the page. There are also no capabilities for advanced search options within the Towers archive which makes searching more difficult.</p>
<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In document search. When searching within an issue it highlights the keywords and tags where they are located within the document for easy searching.</li>
  <li>Fully digitized. The newspapers are digitized and scanned in their entirety so users do not have to ask for issues of interest to be scanned.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No advanced search. The user can only search one keyword at a time and they cannot narrow down search results.</li>
  <li>Sort function. The sort function is not accurate when sorting dates which means it takes more time to locate results.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Part 2- Mini-Usability Test</h1>
<h2>Usability Test Summery</h2>
<p>For the usability test I had a friend look over the website. She was very frustrated throughout the process. I had her speak out loud about how she was feeling and she noted some issues; the site was slow, the newspapers scrolling down was confusing and not like other newspaper database, broken links and issues loading which were only resolved after refreshing the page 3 times.</p>
<p>She also had difficulty looking for material about campus perspectives on World War II and the Vietnam War. She found no newspapers from 1945 which she said immediately threw out any end-of-war articles. She was only able to find one WWII article, because everytime after she tried to open a newspaper the site would crash.</p>
<p>After conduction the search she had a few main takeaways form using the site. She felt the broken links lead to a very frustrating search experience and when searching for articles she found it was easier to just go to a date rather than use the keyword search. For example, when I searched WWII, I would get WWI, and dates that had nothing to do with WWII. Her final take away was that the site was glitchy and hard to navigate.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>When comparing my experience with my friends we both had poor user experiences. Her issues were much more severe than mine. This could be because she was not using a student account and she was also connected to a different wifi hotspot than I was using for my test period. She found the same issues I discovered during my heuristics test and then some. Some changes I would suggest would be to move it over to a different database system entirely. I understand that that is not realistic but some more minor changes I would make is to update and refine the search system, allowing for advanced searches. I would also focus on providing more detailed and clear metadata which will also improve searchability</p>
