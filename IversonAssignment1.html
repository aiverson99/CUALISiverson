<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt;Smithsonian 3D Digitization Database&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Anna Rose Iverson&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h2&gt;System Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian 3D Digitization database is a project of the Smithsonian institution. The Smithsonian institute is the world's largest museum, research, and educational institution with a goal to “the increase and diffusion of knowledge”. The Smithsonian is beginning to utilize the technology of 3D scanning to further its mission to increase and diffuse knowledge. The goal is to gain new audiences and to learn by using 3D replicas of objects held in their collection. Another reason they are focusing on 3D scans is to allow the public to view items that are currently not on display in their museums. The database contains all of the 3D scans that the Smithsonian have collected while working on this project.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h3&gt;Users&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main target audiences for the 3D database&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;ol&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;li&gt;Public&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;li&gt;Educators&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;li&gt;Researchers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;p&gt;The biggest target audience is the public. The database allows the public to interact with objects that are not accessible to them, either because the patron is not in the DC area or the object is not on exhibit. Not only can the public view these 3D scans but in some cases they can 3D print the objects at home.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;p&gt;The second target audience is educators. The 3D scans act as a much more interactive way of learning about objects compared to 2D images. The Smithsonian even has a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;a href="https://3d.si.edu/educator-tools"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>on the 3D database dedicated to educator tools that help best utilize the scans in an educational setting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The final audience are the researchers. 3D scanning does an amazing job in furthering our knowledge of artifacts. The scans allow researchers to interact with the item they are studying without ever having to touch it. This is very important for objects that are fragile and cannot be handled. It also makes it easier to interact with a scaled version of the item. Some artifacts are too small to see the details clearly. Scanning these objects allows researchers to see details that are otherwise too small to see. The same thing can be said about large artifacts. When scaled down it allows researchers to see the object holistically and not fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h3&gt;Content&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The contents of the database cover 20 different Smithsonian institutions. Using the “explore” function users can narrow down their search by museum, topic, media usage, location, and if it is AR enabled. They also have curated “collections” of objects to explore.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The database provides more information than just a 3D scan of the object, it also shares important information regarding the object scanned. The information provided depends on what part of the collection it is from. Objects that are part of the natural history collection include information such as, geologic age, morphology, collection date, collection place, and collector. Information about art objects include descriptions, topics covered, material, object type and record number. I also found that many items also include links to the Smithsonian’s Collection Search Center, a database that provides detailed metadata about the object. Certain entries also allow the user to download the 3D file inorder to print a copy. Not all of the items are open access which limits what can be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h2&gt;System Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The 3D database is a really unique and fascinating resource. It allows the users to interact with 3D objects in interesting ways. On the left side of the 3D scan is a toolbar with different functions. It allows the user to view the item in an AR landscape, provides an interactive tour of the object with zooms in on key aspects of the piece and provides more in depth information, links to share the model on different platforms, and what I found most interesting, a tool bar. The tool bar allows the user to manipulate the scan. Some features include what “material” the scan is made of. The default material is the real-to-life image but there are also modes that allow the scan to be seen in clay, x-ray, normals, and wireframe models. It also allows the user to adjust the lighting of the model from different angles, a measurement feature, and a slice feature.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The pros of this database include its intuitive model which makes it easy to explore. The website is very clickable and it is easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. It also includes objects from multiple Smithsonian institutions which broadens the type of objects that can be found on one database. The cons of the database is that the information fields are not uniform. It is understandable when comparing key information needs of a clam specimen versus a star trek costume but even within similar objects the information fields change. This is most likely because the different institutes have slightly different metadata standards but it is still confusing to the user. I don’t have many major improvements to suggest because this database is very well thought out but if I were to suggest a change it would be to standardize metadata fields.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
